## Kusto Query Language

Kusto Query Language is a simple yet powerful language to query structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. It assumes relational data model of tables and columns with a minimal set of data types. The language is very expressive, easy to read and understand the query intent, and optimized for authoring experiences.
