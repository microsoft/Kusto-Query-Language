# Stored functions

**Functions** are reusable queries or query parts. Functions can be stored as database
entities (similar to, for example, tables) called **stored functions**. Functions can
also be created in an ad-hoc fashion inside queries using a [let statement](../letstatement.md)
through a mechanism called **lambda expressions**.

See [user-defined functions](../functions/user-defined-functions.md) for additional details on the function invocation syntax and rules.
Details on how to create and manage store functions can be found under [managing functions](../../management/functions.md).
