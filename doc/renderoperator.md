# render operator

Instructs the user agent to render the results of the query in a particular way.

<!-- csl -->
```
range x from 0.0 to 2*pi() step 0.01 | extend y=sin(x) | render linechart
```

> [!NOTE]
> The render operator should be the last operator in the query, and used only
> with queries that produce a single tabular data stream result.
>
> The render operator has no impact on the results returned for the query,
> other than to inject a annotation (called "Visualization") that contains
> the rendering information provided in the query.
> User agents might not render results as instructed, depending on their
> support for the required rendering instructions.

**Syntax**

*T* `|` `render` *Visualization* [`with` `(` *PropertyName* `=` *PropertyValue* [`,` ...] `)`]

Where:

* *Visualization* indicates the kind of visualization to use. The supported values are:

|*Visualization*     |Description|
|--------------------|-|
| `anomalychart`     | Similar to timechart, but [highlights anomalies](./samples.md#get-more-out-of-your-data-in-kusto-using-machine-learning) using [series_decompose_anomalies](./series-decompose-anomaliesfunction.md) function. |
| `areachart`        | Area graph. First column is x-axis, and should be a numeric column. Other numeric columns are y-axes. |
| `barchart`         | First column is x-axis, and can be text, datetime or numeric. Other columns are numeric, displayed as horizontal strips.|
| `columnchart`      | Like `barchart`, with vertical strips instead of horizontal strips.|
| `ladderchart`      | Last two columns are the x-axis, other columns are y-axis.|
| `linechart`        | Line graph. First column is x-axis, and should be a numeric column. Other numeric columns are y-axes. |
| `piechart`         | First column is color-axis, second column is numeric. |
| `pivotchart`       | Displays a pivot table and chart. User can interactively select data, columns, rows and various chart types. |
| `scatterchart`     | Points graph. First column is x-axis, and should be a numeric column. Other numeric columns are y-axes. |
| `stackedareachart` | Stacked area graph. First column is x-axis, and should be a numeric column. Other numeric columns are y-axes. |
| `table`            | Default - results are shown as a table.|
| `timechart`        | Line graph. First column is x-axis, and should be datetime. Other (numeric) columns are y-axes. There can be one string column whose values will be used to “group” the numeric columns and create different lines in the chart (further string columns are ignored).|
| `timepivot`        | Interactive navigation over the events time-line (pivoting on time axis)|

* *PropertyName*/*PropertyValue* indicate additional information to use when rendeing.
  All properties are optional. The supported properties are:

|*PropertyName*|*PropertyValue*                                                                   |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`accumulate`  |Whether the value of each measure gets added to all its predecessors. (`true` or `false`)|
|`kind`        |Further elaboration of the visualization kind. See below.                         |
|`legend`      |Whether to display a legend or not (`visible` or `hidden`).                       |
|`series`      |Comma-delimited list of columns whose combined per-record values define the series that record belongs to.|
|`ymin`        |The minimum value to be displayed on Y-axis.                                      |
|`ymax`        |The maximum value to be displayed on Y-axis.                                      |
|`title`       |The title of the visualization (of type `string`).                                |
|`xaxis`       |How to scale the x-axis (`linear` or `log`).                                      |
|`xcolumn`     |Which column in the result is used for the x-axis.                                |
|`xtitle`      |The title of the x-axis (of type `string`).                                       |
|`yaxis`       |How to scale the y-axis (`linear` or `log`).                                      |
|`ycolumns`    |Comma-delimited list of columns that consist of the values provided per value of the x column.|
|`ysplit`      |How to split multiple the visualization. See below.                               |
|`ytitle`      |The title of the y-axis (of type `string`).                                       |
|`anomalycolumns`|Property relevant only for `anomalychart`. Comma-delimited list of columns which will be considered as anomaly series and displayed as points on the chart|

Some visualizations can be further elaborated by providing the `kind` property.
These are:

|*Visualization*|`kind`             |Description                        |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
|`areachart`    |`default`          |Each "area" stands on its own.     |
|               |`unstacked`        |Same as `default`.                 |
|               |`stacked`          |Stack "areas" to the right.        |
|               |`stacked100`       |Stack "areas" to the right and stretch each one to the same width as the others.|
|`barchart`     |`default`          |Each "bar" stands on its own.      |
|               |`unstacked`        |Same as `default`.                 |
|               |`stacked`          |Stack "bars".                      |
|               |`stacked100`       |Stack "bard" and stretch each one to the same width as the others.|
|`columnchart`  |`default`          |Each "column" stands on its own.   |
|               |`unstacked`        |Same as `default`.                 |
|               |`stacked`          |Stack "columns" one atop the other.|
|               |`stacked100`       |Stacl "columns" and stretch each one to the same height as the others.|

Some visualizations support splitting into multiple y-axis values:

|`ysplit`  |Description                                                       |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`none`    |A single y-axis is displayed for all series data. (Default)       |
|`axes`    |A single chart is displayed with multiple y-axis (one per series).|
|`panels`  |One chart is rendered for each `ycolumn` value (up to some limit).|

**Notes**

The data model of the render operator looks at the tabular data as if it has
three kinds of columns:

* The x axis column (indicated by the `xcolumn` property).
* The series columns (any number of columns indicated by the `series` property.)
  For each record, the combines values of these columns defines a single series,
  and the chart has as many series as there are distinct combines values.
* The y axis columns (any number of columns indicated by the `ycolumns`
  property).
  For each record, the series has as many measurements ("points" in the chart)
  as there are y axis columns.

**Tips**

* Only positive values are displayed.
* Use `where`, `summarize` and `top` to limit the volume that you display.
* Sort the data to define the order of the x-axis.
* User agents are free to "guess" the value of properties that are not specified
  by the query. In particular, having "uninteresting" columns in the schema of
  the result might translate into them guessing wrong. Try projecting-away such
  columns when that happens.

<!-- csl -->
```
range x from -2 to 2 step 0.1
| extend sin = sin(x), cos = cos(x)
| extend x_sign = iif(x > 0, "x_pos", "x_neg")
| extend sum_sign = iif(sin + cos > 0, "sum_pos", "sum_neg")
| render linechart with  (ycolumns = sin, cos, series = x_sign, sum_sign)
